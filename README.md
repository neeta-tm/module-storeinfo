# Installation Instruction

<b>Manual Installation</b>

- Copy the content of the repo to the <b>app/code/TechMitraa/StoreInfo</b>

- Run command: <b>php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy</b>

<b>Composer Installation</b>

## Version
We are adding a new version management to make module installation available through composer, so this is the table for reference: 

Magento Version | Composer prefix 
----            | ---- 
2.2.x           | 100.0.0
2.3.X           | 100.0.0

So if you are in magento 2.2.x or magento 2.3.x to install by composer just execute: `composer require neeta-tm/module-storeinfo::100.0.0`

So if you are in magento 2.2.x or magento 2.3.x to install by composer just execute: composer require neeta-tm/module-storeinfo::100.0.0

BUT in file etc/module.xml version will be the same for all composer version, use setup_version as global version reference.
